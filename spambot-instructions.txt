1. Get list of followers: api.twitch.tv/helix/users/follows?to_id=<target streamer id>&first=100.
2. Get spambots: Do forward pagination until you reach the spambots, copy them all, and paste them somewhere that supports regex find and replace
3. Do the following replacements, in order. Note that if you're on Windows use \r\n instead of \n:
find: \s*},\s*{\n} replace with: nothing
find (with . matches newline): \s*"from_i.+?(?=\n)\n\s*"from_name": "([^"]*)",\n.+?(?="from_id")]) replace with: \n\1
find: ^(.+?(?=\n)) replace with: .ban \1 spambot
4. Make sure everything is fine and upload it to pastebin
5. Take the raw pastebin link, and whisper pajbot `!eval bot.privmsg_from_file(<raw pastebin url>)`. See https://github.com/pajbot/pajbot/blob/master/pajbot/bot.py#L434 for more arguments.

There's for sure more effective ways of doing this, but that's what works for me.
